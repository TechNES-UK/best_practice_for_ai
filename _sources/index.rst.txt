Techworks Best Practices in AI
===============================

About
------

This is a best practices guide in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML) for electronic systems engineers in the UK. It aims to
help electronic system engineers to navigate these fields and to
transfer their highly relevant skill-sets into these important domains.

This guide is being actively developed in the open by Techworks, and we welcome
external contributors. While this is primarily a guide for engineers, we
recognize the importance of a diverse skill-set and opinions in our working
group. If you think your experience is relevant to the guide we are producing,
