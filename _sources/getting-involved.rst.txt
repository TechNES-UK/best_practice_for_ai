----------------

The Techworks Best Practices in AI guide is maintained openly, and we welcome
external contributors.

As an engineering oriented guide we especially looking for contributors with
strong technical skills. However, we recognize the importance of a diversity of
skill-sets and experiences in producing a robust guide. There are also many
important areas in the guide (for example legal and ethics), which we recognize
are out of the usual tech skillsets. In short, if you feel you have something
useful to contribute to the guide, please get in touch. 

Group activity for developing this guide is currently co-ordinated via Basecamp.
The group currently meets virtually once a month on each fourth tuesday. If you
are interested in taking part, or you have thoughts or comments then:
