This is the Techworks Best Practices in Artificial Intelligence Guide. It is one
of the core activities of the 
`Techworks AI Innovation Cross Working Group <https://www.techworks.org.uk/Ai>`_
(AI xWG).

The goal of this guide is to help address the AI skill gap in the UK by
empowering our existing engineers to fully adavantage of this technology. The
guide achieves this by laying out best practices guidance for electronic
systems engineers that will allow them both to:

* Quickly access and understand key concepts and ideas in AI and Machine
  Learning; and 
* Work through an AI project from first principles to a completed product.

One of the key strengths of this guide is that it is specifically tailored to
retraining existing electronic systems engineers. These engineers already have
many essential skills, allowing the guide to be highly focused and compact. It
provides a marked contrast to other guides, which typically assume very low
levels of audience knowledge to reach the widest possible audience.
