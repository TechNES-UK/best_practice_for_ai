Executive Summary
=================

This guide is for professional software engineers in the electronics systems
industry who now need to implement Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
(AI/ML) solutions. We make the following two assumptions:

1. the reader is an experienced software engineer; and
2. the reader has no prior experience of AI/ML.

The guide takes the form of a series of questions to be answered.
Comprehensive supplementary information is provided to help answer these
questions. The outcome is an optimally designed, implemented and deployed
AI/ML solution.
