Using this guide
=================================

The 5 main questions are broken into smaller questions, requirements, and tasks
to be completed. We have arranged them  in the order they should be considered
and  strongly advise against skipping ahead. However, you may occasionally  want
to go back and review your earlier answers. 

For each of the 5 main questions the smaller questions, requirements and tasks
are recorded in a table. The table shows the specific activity, and where you
should document evidence of its completion. Some activities may be optional,
depending on earlier responses. Once you have completed all the necessary
activities , you will have your answer to the main question, and can move on to
the next step.
