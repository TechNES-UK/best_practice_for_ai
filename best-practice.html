<p>In this guide, we assume you have a broad end goal in mind to achieve with AI
and Machine Learning. Through this guide, we will take you through the process
of converting this broad goal to a concrete plan.</p>
<p>As we discussed previously, while AI is a powerful tool in many applications it
may not be immediately appropriate for the problem you are trying to solve. This
step requires you to enumerate and assess what available alternative approaches
to solving the problem, and how they compare to an AI solution. This isn’t
intended as a deep dive into the details and risks of your prospective systems,
but a high level check that this engineering approach is right for you.</p>
<p>At this stage, you may not have a complete and full understanding of the scope
and limitations of an AI and Machine Learning approach. However, the design of
this guide is such that you should expect to revisit earlier steps (like this
one) from later steps as your understanding improves. You should therefore fill
this out to the best of your ability, then return to this later as the project
and your understanding evolve.</p>
<p>This step is fairly short, and to complete it, you simply need to list the
viable approaches to solving your problem (including the AI approach), and
compare them. This should include solutions that might not take a data driven
approach, as well as data driven approaches that don’t use learning, for
example, heuristic based approaches. The choice of how to compare these will be
dictated by your use case, but you’re likely to want to consider the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are the financial burdens of each case?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the engineering burdens of each case?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the legal burdens?</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="examples">
<h4>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>In this example, we work through the engineering case for a phishing email
detector.</p>
<p>Our use case is a filter to reduce the success rate of phishing emails. As an
example of how we might think about this, we consider three alternative internal
solutions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A non data driven (or minimally data driven) approach. All emails that are
from external email addresses automatically have a header attached warning
employees that the sender may not be trustworthy, and to apply caution in
respect of the contents.</p></li>
<li><p>A data driven approach that uses engineer designed heuristics instead of a
learning approach. For example, emails are filtered if they:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Are from a list of known “bad” addresses</p></li>
<li><p>Contain too many known “bad” words, e.g. “low interest rate loans”</p></li>
<li><p>Has “.exe” attachments</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>An AI approach that learns from a corpus of previous emails to read an emails
content, and classifies it as phishing, or not phishing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The respective advantages of each approach are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The non data driven approach is simple to implement, requires few resources to
execute, and is simple and cheap to maintain. It will never incorrectly filter
out legitimate emails as it passes the burden of decision making to employees
(with extra information).</p></li>
<li><p>The heuristic approach is also fairly simple to implement, and requires few
resources to execute. It is also very easy to tune for specific requirements
(e.g. never do this, always do this).</p></li>
<li><p>The AI approach will likely have the best performance at identifying spam
emails, if trained on sufficient data. It is also likely to adapt fairly well
to changes in phishing approaches over time, if continually fed with data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The disadvantages of each are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The non-data driven approach provides extra information, but the decision
making ultimately places responsibility on the end user.</p></li>
<li><p>The heuristic approach requires each rule to be created manually, scaling
poorly to large scale problems. Creating effective heuristic rules that do not
result in any real emails being filtered out is also likely to be challenging.
Adapting to new phishing approaches is also likely to be a significant burden,
requiring new rules to be written or old rules to be rewritten.</p></li>
<li><p>The AI approach will need a large corpus of data to learn from which will
have to be prepared appropriately. It will flag real emails incorrectly some
of the time (no matter how well trained), and this may not be easy to fix.
Adoption will require more data preparation and training.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Picking the best approach (or approaches) to use depends on our context. In this
particular example, our non-AI examples are significantly simpler to implement,
and are likely to do better for small scale problems. Other conditions may also
influence the decision. An organization of phishing-aware staff that largely
communicates internally may hugely benefit from the first approach.</p>

<p>In the Using This Guide section, we defined AI risk in several categories:
Unacceptable, High, Limited, and Minimal. Before continuing any further in this
guide, it is important to consider the risk that your project may fall into the
Unacceptable category. These are applications that are a clear threat to the
safety, livelihoods or rights of people, and are not suitable to be solved with
AI. Examples include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>AI systems using subliminal techniques, or manipulative or deceptive
techniques to distort behavior</p></li>
<li><p>AI systems exploiting vulnerabilities of individuals or specific groups</p></li>
<li><p>Biometric categorization systems based on sensitive attributes or
characteristics</p></li>
<li><p>AI systems used for social scoring or evaluating trustworthiness</p></li>
<li><p>AI systems used for risk assessments predicting criminal or administrative
offenses</p></li>
<li><p>AI systems creating or expanding facial recognition databases through
untargeted scraping</p></li>
<li><p>AI systems inferring emotions in law enforcement, border management, the
workplace, and education</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At this stage, you may not have fully fleshed out the scope of your application.
Nonetheless, this initial assessment is important to pre-empt this risk. If you
believe your application may fall into this category, discontinue further work
on it until you have resolved this issue.</p>
<p>To complete this step, complete a risk assessment on the harms your AI project
may pose to the safety, livelihoods or rights of people.</p>

<p>Some types of data are subject to extra difficulties that will either require
extra licensing, oversight, or may be effectively impracticable to collect. This
section is about evaluating the risk that the data you are likely to wish to
collect is available within the constraints of your business. Note that this
section <em>is not</em> a dive into data collection requirements under GDPR, but a higher
level feasibility check. Some examples of types of data that will be
problematic:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Criminal Conviction Data, only processable:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>under the control of official authority; or</p></li>
<li><p>authorized by domestic law.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data collected by experimenting on humans or animals</p>
<ul>
<li><p>requiring extra licensing and oversight</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data surrounding experimentation with infectious diseases</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The specifics of problematic data will depend on the domain the data is being
collected in. At this stage, you may not have fully fleshed out the scope of
your application. Nonetheless, you should, before proceeding further, assess the
risk that this applies to you. If you believe your application may fall into
this category, you should once again discontinue further work on it until you
have resolved this issue.</p>

<p>In the previous section we established, at a high level, the viability of the
project we intend to undertake. In this section we refine the proposed project
into a set of concrete engineering goals. To do this, we open this section by
setting out a little bit more about how AI approaches can be used to solve
problems. We then move through a standard goal setting approach (making sure
goals are Specific, Measurable, etc.), and discuss some of the challenges that
AI approaches can bring for this.</p>
<p>As we discussed, the scope of this guide is such that one can expect to revisit
earlier steps while evaluating later ones. This step in particular, setting a
concrete definition for the project is one that is likely to cause us to
re-evaluate the checks we made in the previous steps. This is fine, and a
natural part of using the guide. Our previous effort is not wasted, but informs
our current and future decisions.</p>
<p>We can break AI approaches into 3 categories. We provide a more detailed
explanation of these terms in the [appendix]. However, briefly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In supervised learning approaches we are learning by example. We have a set of
input data points with corresponding known output data points (labels) for
each. We’re trying to learn what this relationship is so that we can predict
the outputs that correspond to the inputs for unknown data points. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learning to predict stock prices from economic indicators</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to translate one language into another</p></li>
<li><p>Learning the relationship between images chest x-rays and the presence of
cancer</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In unsupervised learning we are learning patterns. We have a set of input data
points without any corresponding output data points. Our goal isn’t to learn
an input-output relationship (because there isn’t one), but to learn things
about the input data points that will generalize to all possible input data
points. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learning to identify clusters of like behavior</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to identify outliers</p></li>
<li><p>Dimensionality reduction</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In reinforcement learning approaches, we are learning by example with an
algorithm that interacts with its environment to select the data points it wants
to learn from. Our goal is to create a policy from which tells the algorithm the
best action to take at any point. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learning to play chess</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to play atari video games</p></li>
<li><p>Autonomous vehicles</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, we assumed that you entered this guide with a broad project goal in
mind. With the above in mind, the goal of this section is to convert that idea
into:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A set of project goals, defining:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What will define when the project will be complete</p></li>
<li><p>What, specifically it needs to achieve</p></li>
<li><p>When this should be completed by</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A set of KPIs, defining:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well the project is currently performing on some important benchmarks</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not cover again the work of general goal setting here, which we assume
should be familiar to any competent engineer. However, over other engineering
projects AI and Machine learning projects have several uncommon considerations.</p>
<p>The first is that AI and Machine Learning algorithms are often stochastic in
nature, behaving in a non-deterministic and statistical way. All goals and KPIs
must be aware of this. For example, for a face detection software it is
appropriate to set goals such as “95% of this set of faces can be recognised”
rather than “the software must recognise all these specific people”.</p>
<p>The second is that human interpretability is a difficult topic in AI and Machine
Learning, and it may be difficult to define why the software is doing the things
or making the decisions that it makes. We will cover this topic (and its
mitigations in more detail) in later sections, but it is important to be aware
that metrics that rely on a deep understanding of functionality may be difficult
to resolve at later stages.</p>
<p>To complete this step:</p>

<section id="defining-the-plan">
<h4>Defining the Plan<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-the-plan" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The first step in creating our AI application is to create and (with caveats)
implement a plan to collect a dataset to drive your AI application. The plan
will include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What data you are going to collect</p></li>
<li><p>Where/whom you are going to collect it from</p></li>
<li><p>How you are going to do this</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to initially approach this is to approach it as you would any novel
software problem: do not reinvent the wheel and never build anything yourself
that you could fairly appropriate from somebody else. There are many free
datasets for a wide range of problems publicly available. Observe what types of
data others who are solving problems similar to you have collected, and what you
can learn about the datasets they used. It may be appropriate in the first
instance, and if a suitable dataset exists, to initially use a public dataset
and iterate. If you do use other datasets, do make sure you respect the licenses
that may come with them.</p>
<p>In most business cases, you will at some point end up collecting your own data.
Even if you don’t, it is important to be aware of what kind of data is desirable
for AI and machine learning, and what kind of data is not. When looking at
potential data, some key criteria to consider are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Accuracy</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does the data accurately measure a quantity you are interested in?</p></li>
<li><p>Not all data can be trusted. Data from questioning human participants
for example, can be inaccurate and contradictory.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Completeness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does the dataset represent a complete view of all data points of interest?</p></li>
<li><p>Does it have more data about some quantities than others? Should it?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your models cannot learn from examples that are not in the data</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Relevance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To what extent is the collected data relevant to the measure of interest?</p></li>
<li><p>Including data that is only weakly relevant may cause more problems than it
solves</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Missingness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Are there missing values in the data?</p></li>
<li><p>Distinct from completeness. Completeness is about overall coverage,
missingness is about which bits of your collected data are not present.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Timeliness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the data still relevant now?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Subjectivity</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AI methods are fundamentally quantitative, and deal best with quantitative
data</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Attainability</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can the data be realistically obtained (and in the quantities required)?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Standardization</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the data collectable/attainable in a standardized format amenable to
computation</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What data you intend to collect is likely to be very tightly tied to where you
collect your data. The best source of data is usually the source that gives the
best data by the criteria we list above. This is not always the only
consideration though, it is also wise to consider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Licensing. This applies both if you’re using an existing dataset licensed by
a third party (even a free one), or if your data might contain licensed work.
As an example of the latter building a dataset of artwork may require you to
consider the licenses of those artworks.</p></li>
<li><p>Personal Data: classes of data (e.g., personal data) must be treated
specially. More on this at the bottom of this section</p></li>
<li><p>Special Cases: Depending on the data and end goal, you may be required to take
additional steps in data collection. For example, data collected by
experimenting on animals is likely to require extra licenses and oversight.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="implementing-the-plan">
<h4>Implementing the Plan<a class="headerlink" href="#implementing-the-plan" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>We discussed supervised and unsupervised learning in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#establish-goals-and-kpis"><span class="std std-ref">Establish Goals and KPIs</span></a> section. If you are
dealing with a supervised learning problem (as is likely), the largest concern
of data collection is how the data can be labeled. In a supervised learning
application, we want to learn to predict some quantity from our data. To do
that, we need examples which match our data and that quantity together. For
example if we want an AI application that detects spam, we need to collect as
data a set of emails, and divide them up into two categories - spam or not.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, you have two choices of how to do this. Firstly, you can contrive
a way to achieve this automatically. If you are predicting how sales from your
website occur based on how people engage with it, it might be a fairly simple
affair for you to match these two bits of information up. Otherwise, if you can
not contrive a way to do otherwise, the data must be labeled manually, by hand.
For example, in a dataset of pictures of animals, the only way to effectively
know what animal is present in the picture is to get a human to decide. In
general, we wish to avoid this - for the purposes of this type of task, humans
are expensive, prone to error and hard to scale.</p>
<p>Other than this, the process of how you will collect your data is simply the
practical realization of what you have set out in the previous steps. Your focus
here is making the process as simple and replicable as possible. As a general
rule, the more automated the process can be, the better. Automated collection
processes scale better, and involving human factors in the collection process is
usually an excellent way to introduce an extra set of errors. Automated data
collection is not possible in every application though. If you do have to have
people involved in your data collection process, try and work as hard as you can
to maximize the consistency of the process for them.</p>
<p>It is worth saying that regardless of the initial choices you make, it is likely
you will revisit this step as you follow the other instructions and find out
what works for you and what does not. This is perfectly fine, and it is much
better initially to pick a dataset, make a start, and iterate, rather than
trying to get it perfect the first time.</p>
<p>The criteria to complete this step are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>To create and implement (with exceptions, see below) a Data Collection Plan.
This is a plan that details:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What data you are going to collect</p></li>
<li><p>Where/who you are going to collect it from</p></li>
<li><p>How you are going to collect the data</p></li>
<li><p>Any extra considerations</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What data you are going to collect should include a data blueprint, a sample of
exactly what you think the data you are going to collect should look like. The
where/who should include specific populations you can feasibly target. The How
should be a plan of action to collect the data from the first step from the
groups you defined in the second step including, where required, a plan for how
the data is to be labeled.</p>
<p>If your AI application is in the high AI Risk category, or you are dealing with
personal data, some special considerations exist. Create this plan, but do not
implement it until you have worked through the following:</p>
<p>For high AI Risk applications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You will be required to provide adequate documentation around data collection,
and log all data collection activity. You will also be required to have human
oversight over the data collection process. Make sure you visit the
Documentation and Logging section of the guide that covers these areas before
collecting any data</p></li>
<li><p>You have a duty to make sure the data you collect is of a high quality to
minimize discriminatory outcomes. Make sure you visit the Data Exploration and
Biases section of the guide before collecting data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For AI applications dealing with personal data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You must collect data according to GDPR regulation. This topic is expanded on
in our Appendix on GDPR.</p></li>

<h4>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>In this example, we work through the case of an oncologist looking to create an
AI application to help other physicians detect the presence of tumors in a chest
x-ray. There is an <cite>example data set creation document&lt;dataset_creation&gt;</cite>,
and a description below:</p>
<p>The data I, as our imaginary oncologist, will need for my application is a set
of chest x-rays, and whether they contain cancer or not.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 47%"/>
<col style="width: 53%"/>
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Data</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>classification</p></th>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>x-ray0.png</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>x-ray1.png</p></td>
<td><p>non-cancerous</p></td>

<td><p>cancerous</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>…</p></td>
<td><p>…</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>In respect to where I can find the data, a starting point is obviously the data
that I can collect from my own patients. I may be able to get data from other
patients from people in my professional network, or simply search online (there
are several publicly available datasets on this particular topic).</p>
<p>In respect of how I can go about collecting (and labeling) my data. I can get
chest X-rays from the sources described above. To label them, I can use my own
expert knowledge, and/or ask other physicians to also contribute to corroborate.</p>
<p>In respect of extra considerations: I am working with personal health data. I’d
likely need to obtain consent from the patients, must respect GDP, and may have
additional requirements to fulfill in respect of my medical license, or an
ethics board to satisfy. It’s likely that this application would also fall into
a high AI Risk category, and be subject to extra requirements.</p>

<p>Any electronic systems engineer should be familiar with version control. These
ideas are just as important in developing AI applications as any other software
product. In this step we explore:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Version control systems for all data collection code</p></li>
<li><p>Version control systems for all data collected</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our reasons for developing version control for data collection code are the same
as they would be for any other software project. We have similar requirements of
the datasets we collect with this code. Just like our code, our data is not
something we can consider static. Not only is it possible we will collect more,
but our existing data may be reorganized, fixed, or updated.</p>
<p>Version control for code is very well established, with a range of standard free
tools (e.g. Git, Mercurial, Subversion) available. Version control of data
requires a little more work. The standard tools used for code control are only
appropriate for a (relatively) small number of small files, tracking a
relatively small number of changes. Many datasets will not meet these criteria.
In these cases we can either extend existing version control with “large file”
control, or with an entirely separate data version control system. Free and Open
Source examples of the above are Git LFS and Data Version Control respectively.</p>
<p>To complete this section, you must:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Set up a version control system for your code and data</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Another task that any electronic systems engineer should be familiar with is
documentation. As with version control, good documentation is just as important,
or perhaps even more so, as any other software development project. In this step
we will explore:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Documentation for the code and;</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation for data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to many software engineering projects, AI projects can often suffer
from large variances in behavior due to the stochastic nature of the algorithms
involved. A consequence of this is that it is imperative to maintain clear
documentation. We must be able to clearly distinguish between acceptable
variances in behavior due to irreducible randomness in our processes, and
unacceptable variances in behavior due to mistakes.</p>
<p>Documentation should follow standard best practices. This is quite a large topic
that has been extensively covered elsewhere
(e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/">Write The Docs</a>), that we won’t
repeat in this guide. Instead, we devote this section to discussing the
additional considerations required for documentation of data. Documentation for
data serves not just a similar function to documentation for code in terms of
bringing clarity and transparency to what has been done, but it also has a
strong role in ensuring reproducibility. In many cases, and especially when
dealing with challenging data (such as data involving human factors), how you
went about collecting this data is just as important as what you ultimately
collected. Ultimately, we suggest that documentation for data should consider
the following three things:</p>
<p><strong>What you collected</strong>. A good description should (if reasonable) include a way
of positively identifying what was collected, where it was collected from, and
when.</p>
<p><strong>How you collected it</strong>. A good description should both include a succinct high
level description of what was done, and include enough detail to allow a full
replication. Especially for complicated data collection paradigms, the devil is
often in the details. Seemingly unimportant details can become important later.</p>
<p><strong>Why you did it this way</strong>. Should both rationalize the process you took and,
crucially, why you did this instead of other things. This gives important
contextual hints to anyone trying to replicate your results that may be absent
from a pure “how” description, and can help them avoid any problems you
encountered in the process.</p>
<p>To achieve this we suggest that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Each piece of data comes with metadata, describing what it is</p></li>
<li><p>Each group of data should be accompanied by a short document describing how
and why it was collected.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This may sound like a significant overhead but, especially if your data is being
collected digitally, the burden is not especially high. Populating metadata can
often be significantly automated, and written documentation may overlap
significantly with the existence and documentation of relevant code. For
example, consider a dataset of images collected by a web scraper. It would be
very easy to include a hash to positively identify what was collected, the web
location it was collected from, and at what time during the scraping process. In
respect of how this data was collected, the code for the webscraper itself
provides a strong description of this. Even in respect of why it was done this
way, the documentation for this code provides a significant amount of context.</p>
<p>High AI Risk applications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For high AI risk applications, documentation is no longer an internally driven
process to improve productivity, but a (likely mandated) part of the
requirement to demonstrate traceability and auditability of the software</p></li>
<li><p>High risk AI Applications must have human oversight. Automated documentation of
data collection will require a level of human oversight and validation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The criteria to complete this step are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Creating documentation for all code written to this point, and standards for
future code</p></li>
<li><p>Creating documentation for any data collected to this point, and a process for
documenting future data</p></li>

<p>Logging is a core requirement of the software development process. It must be
accepted that software will break or not fulfill its function correctly, and
when it does we need to be able to diagnose those faults effectively.
Furthermore, software is rarely static, and in order to change it we must
understand how it works. Finally, in many cases we may wish (or be required) to
audit and review our software, and logging is an important part of this. In this
step, we will explore:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How to create a logging process for out data collection</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When creating a logging process, the first question is always “What should we
log?”. The best place to start with this is to instead start with the question
“what questions do we want to answer about our software?”. Obviously, the answer
to this will depend on the specifics of our data collection, but some recurring
questions you will often need to answer are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Where did I get this piece of data?</p></li>
<li><p>When did I get this piece of data?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the state of my collection program when I collected this data?</p></li>
<li><p>Was collecting this piece of data successful?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was collecting this piece of data unsuccessful?</p></li>

<p>This step is separated from the Data Cleaning step for clarity, but in reality
these two steps are likely to be quite closely linked together. In this step we
will look at the process of exploring the data we collect.</p>
<p>In our steps so far we have designed an AI application, designed a dataset we
think will achieve our goals, and have taken the initial steps to ensure that
there is a robust coding framework around this. Before going any further, we
need to take a look at the data we have collected and try and understand it’s
key characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of the data to establish:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An understanding of the the key characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of the data</p></li>
<li><p>What patterns and relationships exist in the data</p></li>
<li><p>Whether it is likely to be useful for the purpose we intended</p></li>
<li><p>What further data collection should fix, and what it should do more of</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We discussed previously in the guide that you may wish to return to earlier
steps, and this data exploration step is one of the steps which is likely to
encourage this. While this initial examination obviously can not understand the
end result of our full AI pipeline ahead of time, we can build up an
understanding of our data. It’s likely that, especially for the first time, our
data may not be exactly as we had hoped it would be.</p>
<p>Our data exploration process is about trying to digest information about our
dataset. The methods we use to do this are very fundamental, intuitive ideas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Looking directly at the data and subsets thereof</p></li>
<li><p>Trying to understand the data in an intuitive visual way</p></li>
<li><p>Trying to understand the data through summaries and heuristics</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best approach for this will vary, but standard approaches for these are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tabular reports</p></li>
<li><p>Data Visualization</p></li>
<li><p>Data Profiling</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tabular reports.</strong> Forming tabular reports is a very simple way to look at our
data directly. This is simply structuring our data set in a row/column format.
There are no hard rules about how we might want to do this. We could look at
subsets of the data, look at ordered columns, or anything else. Just looking at
the raw data can often be very useful. We can check our intuitions about the
data, identify potential patterns, and notice errors that may be hard to
identify other ways.</p>
<p><strong>Data Visualization.</strong> Directly examining data is useful in a way that should
not be discarded. However, most of us will find it more useful to process data
visually. There are a very large number of ways to do this. Edward Tuft lists a
series of key ideas that are often cited for this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>show the data</p></li>
<li><p>induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology,
graphic design, the technology of graphic production, or something else</p></li>
<li><p>avoid distorting what the data has to say</p></li>
<li><p>present many numbers in a small space</p></li>
<li><p>make large data sets coherent</p></li>
<li><p>encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data</p></li>
<li><p>reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to the fine
structure</p></li>
<li><p>serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation, or
decoration</p></li>
<li><p>be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data
set.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Good visualizations are often as much of an art as a science. As with many
things for which this is the case, the best initial approaches are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Start from the basics, the simple tools that everyone else uses (line plot,
scatter graphs, heatmaps)</p></li>
<li><p>Unashamedly appropriate good ideas from other people doing similar things</p></li>
<li><p>Explore your own ideas to find out works for you and what does not</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Profiling.</strong> Data profiling tries to capture yet another approach to
understanding our data, this time through the use of summarizations and
statistics about our data.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What groupings (or clusters) within in our data</p></li>
<li><p>Averages (mean, median, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Spreads (standard deviation, quartiles, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of this we might want to explore how different bits of our data relate
to each other. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Comparing different data</p></li>
<li><p>Correlating different data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside these broad techniques, we might also choose to do a detailed
“drilldown” into our data and run a more detailed analysis of some parts. We
might look at some more advanced statistics or visualizations of these subsets,
or even perform a small scale trial run of some AI approaches we are considering
later.</p>
<p>To criteria to complete this step is to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create a data exploration process</p></li>
<li><p>Create a data exploration report</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The raw data that is collected through our data collection process is not
necessarily the best data to use in training our algorithm. Some parts of our
data might be poor quality for one reason or another. Following our previous
examples, we should look for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Accuracy</p></li>
<li><p>Completeness</p></li>
<li><p>Relevance</p></li>
<li><p>Missingness</p></li>

<p>Hopefully, the data analysis we discussed in the previous step will have
uncovered many of these issues already. If there are any issues with the data
quality you have not explored, so far, this is the step to do them (using the
techniques in the last section).</p>
<p>As with visualizing the data, the best way to clean it will depend on your
problem and precisely what it is you’re trying to do with it. However, there are
some common problems for which there are well established solutions:</p>
<p><strong>Basic Cleaning.</strong> Not all data collection processes perform ideally.
Particularly, if many data sources are aggregated together, it’s very possible
to see errors such as duplicated data points, or inconsistent labels (“eleven”
vs 11, for example). The following is a list of these common errors, and what
can be done about each:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Formatting</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Convert all labels to one format or representation. For example, all numbers
as digits, or all dates as DD/MM/YY.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data duplication</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check for duplicate entries and remove them.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Structural issues</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Not all data sources may have collected the same data. Choose which ones to
keep</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Irrelevant data</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove if if you are not going to use it</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Errors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fix or remove any data points with errors (e.g. spelling mistakes from user
input)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list, but you should at the minimum consider each of
these in your data cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>Missing/corrupt data.</strong> A very common problem is for some parts of the data to
be missing. For many AI techniques we might want to apply later, this is an
issue. The ideal thing to do about this problem is to collect a fresh set of
data with less (or ideally zero) parts missing. Obviously, this is not always
practical. If we can not do this, then we essentially have two solutions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Cut all entries with missing data points out</p></li>
<li><p>Use an AI technique that is robust to the missing data</p></li>
<li><p>Impute our data, filling in estimates of the missing values</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We won’t cover the techniques for any of these in detail, for which there are a
wealth of resources elsewhere (imputation), but we note that the extent to which
any of these strategies is plausible depends on how the missingness in our data
has come about. There are three ways the data might be missing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Missing totally at random (MCAR) - the data is missing completely randomly
with no pattern at all</p></li>
<li><p>Missing random (MAR) - the data is missing randomly, but in a way that is
explained by the data you are using to predict things</p></li>
<li><p>Missing not at random (MNAR) - the data is missing in a way that is not
explained by the data you are using to predict things</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As an example of the first, might be some bits of our data being deleted
randomly by a bad sensor. An example of the last would be a survey about
depression - participants with severe depression are more likely to refuse to
complete the survey about depression severity. An example of the second is a
little more tricky. Consider a dataset of blood pressure, containing both a
group of old participants and young participants. Clearly, data won’t be missing
entirely at random because older participants are more likely to have their
blood pressure measured. However, as long as this is the only difference between
the two groups, this is not usually a problem. We can e.g. treat them
separately.</p>
<p>The distinction between these can be a bit subtle, but the headline from this is
as follows: When data is missing either completely randomly (MCAR), or for a
reason we fully understand and can measure (MAR), this is fine. We can use data
imputation, or (for some AI models) adapt our model to this situation. When data
is missing for a reason we do not understand and/or can not measure (MNAR), we
(typically) can not do either and this is not. If you find yourself in this
case, typically you need to reformulate the problem. For example, accounting for
the fact that the data point is missing as a point of data in itself.</p>
<p><strong>Removing Outliers.</strong> Removing outliers is technically simple - there are a
range of techniques to do this that we will not re-cover here. The reason we
have included this short section is to cover when you should consider removing
outliers and when you should not.</p>
<p>Shortly, outliers are data points too. It can be tempting to remove them if they
are, for example, making large contributions to an average that you feel is
skewing your measure of interest. However, doing this without a valid reason
causes problems. Especially, removing data points because they do not agree with
your expectations will ultimately lead you to believe them to be true even when
they are not true.</p>
<p>The valid reasons to remove an outlier data point are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You believe that it is a measurement error</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is an outlier because the process user to measure is in error</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You believe it is a data entry or processing error</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is an outlier because the way it has been entered into storage or processed is in error</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You believe that your sampling process is incorrect</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is an outlier because the way the data point has been chosen over others is in error</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A datapoint is a measurement error if the process used to measure it has
measured it incorrectly.</p>

<p>We established a good idea of what qualities our data has (and does not have)
from our previous steps. Unfortunately, if and when we collect more of this
data, we have no guarantee that things are going to stay the same. Similarly, we
want to be sure that in the process of storing and moving the data around, we
are not introducing new errors. We therefore want to set up an automated
monitoring and testing process to look at the data as we collect it.</p>
<p>Very broadly, we hope with this validation and testing process to be checking
two things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does my data look like I expect it to?</p></li>
<li><p>Is my data remaining of a high quality?</p></li>
<li><p>Or at least, is it broken in all the ways I expect it to be and none of the
ones I do not</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The way we go about this is with a tool that should be familiar to any software
engineer: writing tests. The criteria for these tests may have to be a little
different from usual. Our data collection process is ultimately stochastic, and
so a lot of our tests will have to be stochastic too. Examples include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Checking if data falls within the min-max ranges of that data element (based
on all previous data registered),</p></li>
<li><p>Defining several validation rules, and display data units violate these
validation rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis of data sets, i.e., examining gaps in data, missing values, existing
trends, and so forth</p></li>

<section id="data-storage-and-access">
<span id="id19"></span><h3><a class="reference internal" href="using-the-guide.html#how-do-i-collect-data-for-my-ai-ml-project"><span class="std std-ref">Data Storage and Access</span></a><a class="headerlink" href="#data-storage-and-access" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Having collected this data, we need to think about how it is going to be stored
and accessed. The solution to this will vary significantly depending on the
scale of the operations we are dealing with. Small, lightweight projects might
be adequately managed in a spreadsheet, big ones might require a large data
warehousing system integrating multiple sources of data.</p>
<p>This section is not intended to be a reintroduction to the technical details of
data storage and management, but a review of the problems and considerations around using them in these types of workflows.</p>
<p><strong>Structured vs unstructured storage.</strong> When collecting your data, you have the
option of storing it in an unstructured form (e.g. in a raw data format), or
storing it in a structured format (e.g. a database).</p>
<p>While you are ultimately very likely to need your data to be in a structured
format at some point for your analysis, it is not always advantageous to store
it in this format.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On one hand, storing data in a structured format decreases the flexibility you
have to store that data, and requires you to commit ahead of time to a data
model that involves that format that you choose.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, if you can pre-specify a structure for your data, it will
significantly reduce the amount of time and effort we need to spend
structuring it later.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The tradeoff between these two will depend on your application. General
considerations are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How much does storing raw data cost me, versus structuring it?</p></li>
<li><p>How much effort will it be to convert raw data into the structured format I
will need later, if I don’t do it on collection?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the realistic opportunity cost for forcing my data collection into a
structured format, versus unstructured collection?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data validation &amp; multiple data sources.</strong> The data collection process is
rarely perfect, and these problems are often compounded when data is collected
from multiple sources, and integrated together later on for analysis. This is
one of the causes of many problems that we discussed in the data cleaning
section:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Formatting</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Convert all labels to one format or representation. For example, all numbers as digits, or all dates as DD/MM/YY.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data duplication</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check for duplicate entries and remove them.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Structural issues</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Not all data sources may have collected the same data. Choose which ones to keep</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Irrelevant data</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove if you are not going to use it</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Errors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fix or remove any data points with errors (e.g. spelling mistakes from user input)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While you should continue to deal with these issues as part of your data
cleaning, you should also solve as many of them as you can as part of your data
management process. For example, applying a universal enforcement that all
numbers should be entered into the system as digits.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud vs Local.</strong> It can often be very attractive to pay for someone else to
store data with a cloud service. We will not cover the general merits of cloud
vs local storage here, which we assume are already known.</p>
<p>The main additional considerations in the contexts of AI and machine workloads
are what you are doing to do with the data you have stored. Training is an
access intensive process, and how you intend to get the data from wherever it is
stored to the computing power doing the storage has a strong impact on
performance.</p>
<p>Shortly, whichever of local vs cloud computing you intend to use for training
your model, you should consider how this is going to translate into storage.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Requirements.</strong> Not all storage is created equal. The target
audience of this guide should be well aware that there are a range of physical
solutions from magnetic tapes to SSDs for storing and retrieving data that
tradeoff cost and performance, with similar cost models for cloud storage
systems.</p>
<p>For AI systems, it is worth considering that data that is going to be used
directly for training will need to be accessed quickly and repeatedly during the
process. In many cases making an investment in high performance storage may
speed up the process significantly. However, not all applications will be like
this, and not all data will directly be part of the training process. Raw
unstructured data, infrequently accessed, for example, may be a prime candidate
for lower performance storage.</p>

<p>There is not a set way of picking an AI algorithm to use in every case. In the
appendix we list how some common algorithms match up to the problems we
describe below, but this should not be taken prescriptively. The most practical
suggestion in most cases is to use these as suggestions for as a starting point,
and iterate. What others are doing with similar problems is another good
starting point.</p>
<p>We break up the problems you need to think about when selecting an algorithm
into three parts. The first are practical considerations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What computational resources do you have available?</p></li>
<li><p>How much data do you have, and how are you going to get it to the computer
that you are using to train?</p></li>
<li><p>How many resources (time, money, etc.) are you willing to spend on training?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of the decisions in this area boil down to scaling. Almost any algorithm
can be deployed at some scale. The key question is what is the best algorithm
that I can deploy for my scale of data and available resources? It is important
to remember as part of this that not all algorithms scale equally - either with
amount of data or dimensionality.</p>
<p>The second set of considerations are use case based. Especially, what, if any,
special requirements do you have for your end system? For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do the outcomes need to be explained in a human understandable way?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I need to be able to enforce certain behavior in my model?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I need to be able to explain or understand uncertainty in my model?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of the above are common requirements that significantly limit the
available choices of algorithms.</p>
<p>Our third and final category are technical considerations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do prospective approaches match up with the underlying assumptions of each
algorithm?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the complexity of my prospective algorithm appropriate for the problem I’m
solving</p></li>
<li><p>How do limitations of my data affect my choice?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to remember with these points that all AI models are just
models, and will never reflect reality in full detail. Nor do we necessarily
want them to - as we see in the appendix on Bias and Variance, often a
purposely simpler model can produce better results than a more complex one,
especially when data or training is limited. Limitations on training data can be
important too. Some AI algorithms cannot deal with data that has missing parts,
for example. This must either be addressed, or a different approach used.</p>

<p>This step has a lot of overlap with our previous Collecting Data subsection on
Data Cleaning. Our focus here is slightly different, with us instead looking at
maximizing the efficacy of our training process, rather than specifically
focusing on fixing deficiencies in the data.</p>
<p><strong>Missing data.</strong> Depending on your choice of AI Algorithm, missing data may
have suddenly become extremely important. If this is the case, revisit the Data
Collection section, Data Cleaning subsection in the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling and Transforming data.</strong> For many models, the training process can be
improved by scaling or transforming the data. For example, scaling all values to
be on the same scale.</p>
<p>There are a range of reasons you might want to do this. A common example is two
features being on different scales. If we have one feature that takes on values
in the range 0-1, and another that takes on values in the range 0-100, some
types of analysis may cause us to weigh one more heavily than the other.</p>
<p>Which technique will be applied will depend on your analysis and goals. Some
common techniques would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Removing the average from a set of numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Transforming all values to the same scale</p></li>
<li><p>Scaling all values to a normal distribution</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dimensionality Reduction.</strong> Sometimes our datasets include a large number of
features. This can be a blessing because it gives us more information to
integrate into our analysis, but it can also cause difficulties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It increases computational cost of training</p></li>
<li><p>It can cause overfitting, especially if the extra features are not useful</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple weak features are often a less useful explanation than one or two
strong ones</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A way of dealing with this is to reduce the dimensionality of the data. There
are two very broad ways of approaching this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We can select the most useful features from our existing set of features</p></li>
<li><p>We can aggregate our current features to create a new set of features with
beneficial features</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage of the first is that we can perform dimensionality reduction with
the existing features to select the best ones. The advantage of the second is
that, although our constructed dimensions lose interpretability, the process by
which we create them typically makes them very strong at explaining our data.</p>
<p>To complete this step you must:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create a pre-processing procedure for your data</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In this step you must create an automated process to ingest the data collected,
cleaned and preprocessed, and use it to train a model.</p>
<p>For small projects, this may be a very simple script consisting of a few lines
of code collecting the data and running the training function. For larger
projects, larger datasets, or non-standard tools this may be significantly
harder.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware Acceleration.</strong> Many machine workloads can be significantly sped up
using hardware that shifts computationally intensive parts of the training
process to specialized processing units. These technologies generally work by
improving matrix arithmetic. It is not always necessary or desirable to do this,
but it can be very beneficial for some workloads. Neural Networks are one
example where hardware acceleration has been very successful.</p>
<p>Though there are special processors available for this, modern graphics cards
also do this type of processing, are often competitive on cost-per-processing
power basis, and have additional uses (e.g. as graphics processors).</p>
<p><strong>Storage Mediums.</strong> This is an excellent opportunity to revisit the Collecting
Data section, under the subsection of Data Storage and Access. The discussion on
different data storage mediums is extremely relevant to training.</p>
<p><strong>Large Datasets &amp; Resource Intensive Projects.</strong> Larger projects may end up in
a situation in which the dataset is not stored on one machine, and/or
computation must be spread across multiple distributed units. Future iterations
of this guide will cover this issue, currently we suggest that readers seek
expert advice on this complex topic.</p>

<p>Testing how the model performs through its training process is extremely
important. For models of small scale, it is a vital diagnostic tool. For models
of a large scale, it allows us to identify problems early, before too many
resources are committed to them.</p>
<p><strong>Training Error.</strong> It’s important to split your dataset into at least 2 parts -
a training dataset and a testing dataset. Most (e.g. 90%) of your data will be
in the training dataset, and this will be what you use to do your training.
Entirely separately from this</p>
<p><strong>Parameters and Hyperparameters.</strong> As important as always. We are essentially
testing for extremely similar things as the testing and validation for the data
collection, but the downstream versions.</p>
<p><strong>Bias.</strong> If there are specific biases of concern in your dataset, you should
check these during training. This should be done by creating a test of bias, and
periodically running it during the training process.</p>

<p>A large part of this is discussed in the previous section under “collecting
data”. The extra considerations for the training process are that we must now
firmly keep track of two, nested versionings. We need to keep track of not just
the version of the code that was used to train a model, but the version of any
data used to train the model too.</p>

<p>There is significant overlap between this section and the Documentation and
Logging section of the Collecting Data section.</p>
<p>One thing to clearly document in the training process is any hyperparameters
associated with the algorithm you are using. These will have a significant
effect on the training process. For example, learning rate in a neural network,
or the parameters of the kernel in a Support Vector Machine. In addition to
these, it is important to keep track of and document all decisions you are
making in your training pipeline. Qualities like the batch size of training in a
neural network might not be a hyperparameter in a certain narrow sense, but can
make almost as much difference to the outcome of training.</p>

<p>Deployment means taking your trained model from an offline environment to a real
world or production system. Exactly what you will need to do for this will
depend a lot on what your application is and what you want to do with it.
However, some things that you should always consider:</p>
<p><strong>Where you are deploying it (edge, vs centralized).</strong> As with training, an
important part of realizing your deployment will be formulating a way of getting
your data from wherever it is collected, to the deployed model. One of the ways
that you can reduce the cost of getting your data to your models is to deploy
them in a location near the source of the data they will be ingesting. The
advantages of this are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Model receives data quickly and can respond quickly, possibly in real time</p></li>
<li><p>Data transfer costs are reduced</p></li>
<li><p>Security burden of transfers is reduced</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some disadvantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Spreading computing power reduces the capacity of each individual unit</p></li>
<li><p>Deploying and maintaining a large number of systems in physically diverse set
of locations introduces difficulties</p></li>
<li><p>For security purposes, deploying a large number of nodes introduces a larger
attack surface</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The calculus of this decision will vary between projects, however we note that
large projects often find that the cost of transferring large amounts of data
can be very substantial.</p>
<p><strong>How you are deploying it (internally, externally).</strong> All of the usual caveats
and problems in deploying systems apply. Our product must be prepared for all
cases of misuse we can reasonably prepare for, malicious or otherwise.</p>
<p>For AI systems there are several additional complications to consider, both when
deploying systems internally or (especially) externally. Unfortunately, a theme
of these issues is that they are all currently difficult to completely
eliminate. This shouldn’t necessarily prevent you from deployment, but might
require you to take some extra care.</p>
<p><strong>Out of Sample errors.</strong> For some AI systems, making queries that are
substantially outside the scope of the training data will lead to nonsensical
results. This can be a problem because it is not usually clear to the user what
is in scope and what is out of scope. Knowing how much a result can be trusted
can be problematic.</p>
<p>An extension from this if the system is exposed externally is that an adversary
may attempt to purposely design an input to the system that produces unexpected
results. As a real world example consider a research project designing stickers
that, when applied to speed signs, cause an onboard computer vision AI to
misread the speed limit.</p>
<p>This is difficult to fully resolve, and there is no single solution to this
problem currently. If it is of utmost imperative that this behavior is fixed,
some possible solutions are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use techniques that can guarantee behavior (e.g. statistical models can bound
error rate if their assumptions hold)</p></li>
<li><p>Some techniques (e.g. Bayesian methods) can estimate confidence in solutions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The difficulty with both of these approaches is that they place substantial
restrictions on the overall class of available models. Practically in most
cases, the solution needs to be considered at a higher level than the algorithm
itself. Whatever process it is part of should consider the fact that solutions
cannot be guaranteed to be sensible. Rigorous testing should identify and
eliminate as many of these problems as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Training Data/Model Leakage.</strong> When somebody queries an AI model, they learn
two things. They learn something about how the model understands data, and
something about the data it was trained on itself. This is a problem because
with enough effort, an attacker can steal both of these things.</p>
<p><strong>Data Leakage.</strong> Consider the statistic that 87% of the US population can be
uniquely identified by gender, ZIP code and full date of birth. It can take a
surprisingly small amount of information to uniquely identify individual points
of data. Large, data driven systems like AI are especially vulnerable to this.
Some AI systems (notably large language models) have also been known to leak
training data when queried directly.</p>
<p>This is a problem that is difficult to fully prevent. There are some techniques
that can substantially reduce the threat:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Removal of identifying variables</p></li>
<li><p>Differential privacy mechanisms</p></li>
<li><p>Private model training techniques</p></li>
<li><p>Use of synthetic data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, a problem with these techniques is that they introduce limitations and
complexity on the final result. Whether this is worth it depends on the
application.</p>
<p><strong>Model Leakage.</strong> Querying a model gives information about how it sees the
relationship between input and output variables. With enough examples of this,
it is possible for an adversary to effectively recover the model. Examples don
not necessarily even need to be related to the original training set, though it
is beneficial.</p>
<p>There are several approaches that can reduce the impact of this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Restricting the number of queries to the model</p></li>
<li><p>Watermarking the model, to identify stolen models</p></li>
<li><p>Adding noise, and Differential Privacy approaches</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What you are deploying it on (hardware)
This section strongly corresponds to the training pipeline set out in the
training section, and will be expanded in future.</p>
<p>To complete this step:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Deploy your model</p></li>
